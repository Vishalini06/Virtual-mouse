# Virtual Mouse using Hand Gestures

## Overview

This Python application utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to control the computer cursor using hand gestures, effectively enabling hands-free mouse control. The application detects hand landmarks in real-time through a webcam feed, interprets specific gestures, and translates them into mouse movements and clicks on the screen.

## Features

- **Hand Detection**: Uses MediaPipe Hands module to detect and track hand movements.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes specific gestures (e.g., thumb and index finger pinch) to simulate mouse clicks and movements.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple to set up and run with minimal dependencies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pyautogui`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-mouse.git
   cd virtual-mouse
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python virtual_mouse.py
   ```

## How It Works

The application uses the following steps to operate:

1. **Capture Video Feed**: Accesses the webcam using OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`).
   
2. **Hand Detection**: Utilizes MediaPipe Hands module (`mp.solutions.hands.Hands()`) to detect landmarks (e.g., fingers) on detected hands in the video frame.
   
3. **Gesture Recognition**: Identifies specific landmarks (e.g., index and thumb fingers) and calculates their positions relative to the screen dimensions.
   
4. **Mouse Control**: Translates detected gestures into mouse movements and actions using PyAutoGUI (`pyautogui`) to move the cursor and simulate clicks based on predefined conditions.

## Usage

- **Start the Application**: Run `python virtual_mouse.py`.
- **Perform Gestures**: Place your hand in front of the webcam and perform gestures (e.g., pinch with thumb and index finger).
- **Interact with the Screen**: Use gestures to move the cursor or click on objects on the screen.
